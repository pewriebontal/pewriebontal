### Ayo, KAI here!

I write code, build systems from the ground up, and create tools that solve real (cough) problems. I spend my days mastering Unix (ricing my distro) because I’d rather type than click.

- Working through 42's Curriculum, focusing on C.
- Pronouns: he/him (hardcore)
- Splitting my brain between Newcastle's IT program and 42SUTD's Computer Science - because one degree isn't enough punishment and sleep is overrated anyway.
- Full-time daydreamer, part-time ["DJ"](https://img.bontal.net/p/0), and occasional [blogger](https://blog.bontal.net) when I need a break from memory management.
- Fan of dystopian sci-fi films, perfect for when reality feels too tame.

### Projects I've Built

- **[Catalyst](https://catalyst.bontal.net):** A to-do app for lazy people. You type, AI figures it out. Built in Flutter, local-first, no forms, no friction.
- **[NLEX](https://nlex.bontal.net):** A shell that lets you talk to your terminal. Written in Go, it turns plain English into shell commands so you stop Googling `sed` syntax.
- **Where's my Classroom?:** Fixed my university's broken timetable because scattered PDFs are a crime. A Flutter app that sorts out the mess and works offline.
- **[bjsh](https://github.com/pewriebontal/bjsh):** A Unix shell built from scratch in C that doesn't just echo commands—it handles processes like a boss and doesn't crash (usually).
- **[BYAMC](https://github.com/pewriebontal/byamc):** My own C standard library because why use something that works when you can build it yourself? Memory management is my therapy.
- **Byte's Escape**: 2D game built from scratch in C, no fancy engines, just raw C code and pain because I hate myself apparently.


### Infrastructure

- **[BitTorrent Tracker](https://bt.bontal.net):** My public BitTorrent tracker and Monitoring tool because why not? go get it on the website and put it in your torrent client's tracker list. And don't forget to seed!

### Tech I Use Because It Gets The Job Done

- **Languages**: **C** and **Go** for systems & backend. **Dart/Flutter** for making apps. **Python** and **TypeScript** when I have to. The right tool for the job.
- **Operating Systems**: Linux when I want things to work, Windows when I need to suffer.
- **Tools**: Git, Makefiles, and sometimes Vim - because IDEs are for the weak (kidding, I use JetBrains stuff too because I'm not insane).

    <summary><strong>The hardware I torture daily</strong></summary>
    <ul>
        <li>CPU: Intel® Core™ i9-13900H (14 cores, 20 threads - overkill for most days, but compiling C without waiting is nice)</li>
        <li>GPU: NVIDIA® Geforce RTX™ 3050 4GB (handles visualization just fine, occasional gaming when I need a break from segfaults)</li>
        <li>RAM: 16GB LPDDR5 (wish it was 32GB but we can't have everything)</li>
        <li>SSD: 1TB NVMe (fast enough that waiting for compiles is almost bearable)</li>
        <li>OS: OpenSUSE Tumbleweed Dualboot with Windows 11.</li>
    </ul>
