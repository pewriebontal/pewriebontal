### Ayo, KAI here!

I hack on code, build systems from scratch, and ship stuff that actually works‚Äîusually by wrangling Unix because life's too short for point-and-click garbage.

- üî≠ Grinding through 42's Core Curriculum - diving deep into C where the real magic happens, not that abstracted high-level nonsense.
- üòÑ Pronouns: he/him (hardcore)
- üéì Splitting my brain between Newcastle's IT program and 42SUTD's Computer Science - because one degree isn't enough punishment and sleep is overrated anyway.
- ‚ö° Full-time daydreamer, part-time ["DJ"](https://img.bontal.net/p/0), and occasional [blogger](https://blog.bontal.net) when I need a break from memory management.
- üéûÔ∏è Low-key obsessed with dystopian sci-fi flicks - because the real world isn't bleak enough already.

### Stuff I've Built That Actually Works

- **[Catalyst](https://catalyst.bontal.net):** A to-do app for lazy people. You type, AI figures it out. Built in Flutter, local-first, no forms, no friction.
- **[NLEX](https://nlex.bontal.net):** A shell that lets you talk to your terminal. Written in Go, it turns plain English into shell commands so you stop Googling `sed` syntax.
- **Where's my Classroom?:** Fixed my university's broken timetable because scattered PDFs are a crime. A Flutter app that sorts out the mess and works offline.
- **[bjsh](https://github.com/pewriebontal/bjsh):** A Unix shell built from scratch in C that doesn't just echo commands‚Äîit handles processes like a boss and doesn't crash (usually).
- **[BYAMC](https://github.com/pewriebontal/byamc):** My own C standard library because why use something that works when you can build it yourself? Memory management is my therapy.
- **Byte's Escape**: 2D game built from scratch in C‚Äîno fancy engines, just raw code and pain. DFS for map validation because I hate myself apparently.

### Tech I Use Because It Gets The Job Done

- **Languages**: **C** and **Go** for systems & backend. **Dart/Flutter** for making apps. **Python** and **TypeScript** when I have to. The right tool for the job.
- **Operating Systems**: Linux when I want things to work, Windows when I need to suffer.
- **Tools**: Git, Makefiles, and sometimes Vim - because IDEs are for the weak (kidding, I use JetBrains stuff too because I'm not insane).

    <summary><strong>The hardware I torture daily</strong></summary>
    <ul>
        <li>CPU: Intel¬Æ Core‚Ñ¢ i9-13900H (14 cores, 20 threads - overkill for most days, but compiling C without waiting is nice)</li>
        <li>GPU: NVIDIA¬Æ Geforce RTX‚Ñ¢ 3050 4GB (handles visualization just fine, occasional gaming when I need a break from segfaults)</li>
        <li>RAM: 16GB LPDDR5 (wish it was 32GB but we can't have everything)</li>
        <li>SSD: 1TB NVMe (fast enough that waiting for compiles is almost bearable)</li>
        <li>OS: Windows 11 + WSL2 with Arch Linux (because dual booting is so 2010)</li>
    </ul>
